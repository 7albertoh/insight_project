5 Secrets of The Matrix,My many years of life coaching and family - relationship therapy practice made me realize that regardless of how many books one reads and how many webinars – seminars one attends  the core of the matter is missing. People try to build a rock castle on quicksand that starts running and undermines the future. Even though the time and place of a beginning is an individual decision lack of success speaks for itself. Another false assumption is that life has separate compartments that are not in connection with each other. This belief causes quite a lot of heartache and sadness on the path.In this book  I attempt to awaken your memory by building a bridge between the conscious and the subconscious. I talk about energies in a physical sense. I talk about ancient numerology with ancient astrology; everything that can be physically proven. I do not take on any wildings that cannot fit into my philosophy I call AKIA  for everything is interrelated therefore cosmic knowledge is a mirror of the unseen soul. To help understand I give you the AKIA mantra I put together and encoded for my students AKIA INVOCATIONGreat Creator  who created the Universe  with me in it to look after and further your magnificent work that I accepted in good faith but could not always deliver because through my self-centrednessI chose not to see only look not to listen only hear not to feel only think.Without understanding nature s harmonious cycle I stepped out of it  not suspecting that I would not be protectedand I would become an instrument of outside forces.Please  give me the strength to forgive myselffor every bad deed  I committed againstanybody and anything - including myself –wisdom to others to forgive me.Show me the way back to nature s cyclewhere I can live in peace and dignity without indulging in suffering in a place  where love is unconditional.

Life in Christ  Lessons from Our Lords Miracles and Parables,Original title  Miracles and Parables of Our Lord. Volume 1A deep  inspiring  and often challenging study of the Lord Jesus Christ s miracles and parables. Men who were led by the hand or groped their way along the wall to reach Jesus were touched by his finger and went home without a guide  rejoicing that Jesus Christ had opened their eyes. Jesus is still able to perform such miracles. And  with the power of the Holy Spirit  his Word will be expounded and we ll watch for the signs to follow  expecting to see them at once. Why shouldn t those who read this be blessed with the light of heaven? This is my heart s inmost desire. I can t put fine words together. I ve never studied speech. In fact  my heart loathes the very thought of intentionally speaking with fine words when souls are in danger of eternal separation from God. No  I work to speak straight to your hearts and consciences  and if there is anyone with faith to receive  God will bless them with fresh revelation. - Charles H. SpurgeonIn this first volume  Charles H. Spurgeon expounds on the following miracles • Jesus heals two blind men by touching their eyes (Matthew 9 27-30). • Jesus uses spit to heal another blind man (Mark 8 22-25). • Jesus passes through the midst of those who would kill him (Luke 4 28-30). • Jesus brings a widow s son back to life (Luke 7 11-17). • Jesus releases a woman from a spirit of infirmity (Luke 13 10-13). • Jesus heals ten lepers but only one thanks him (Luke 17 12-16). • Jesus gently rebukes his mother then makes wine for the wedding (John 2 1-5). • Jesus tests a nobleman s faith and his son is healed (John 4 46-53).

My People  the Amish  The True Story of an Amish Father and Son,In My People  the Amish  Joe Keim paints a detailed picture of life behind the bonnets and buggies. More than a biography  this is an honest look at the heart-warming traditions that mingle with the deep-rooted legalism of the Amish community in Ashland  Ohio.Born  raised  and baptized in an Old Order Amish church  from childhood Joe Keim was taught that if he didn t follow the twenty-two-page ordinance letter that governed his community  there was no way he could get to heaven. What started as a path of rebellion led Joe and his wife Esther to a caring group of Englisher Christians who would love them like family and show them how to live out their new found faith in Jesus Christ. Nine months after their traditional Amish wedding  Joe and Esther left family and friends forever to live openly for Christ  and endured shunning and excommunication with bold faith. Since then  the Lord has brought many former Amish people to Joe and Esther for help. Because of their passion for the Amish people and with the support of fellow believers  they have brought biblical truth to thousands of Amish through the ministry they founded in 2000  Mission to Amish People (MAP).

Thank God.  A woman could only take so many lying philanderers in her life and once was definitely more than enough. Of course  Jeff would remind her that psychologists shouldn t dissect their personal lives like case studies. Easy for him to say. He had a wife who loved him and a baby on the way. What did she have besides a hurt so deep she couldn t take a full breath? You d only be in California until I can get things squared away here. Then I ll be right out. A few weeks at the most.  His voice softened.  Nina s having another ultrasound today. The bleeding s stopped. Sara pushed past the queasiness in her belly.  I know how much you both want this baby.  The doctor thinks everything will be okay  but I can t leave until we know for sure. But Matt needs help now. His brother said he s getting worse every day and lately he won t let anybody near him.  Not even one of those little starlets of his?  If the tabloids were accurate  company  especially the female variety  was plentiful.Jeff frowned.  You shouldn t believe everything you read. He was right  of course. The remark was not something a psychologist should say even if she thought it.  I m sorry  that was unkind. I don t even know the man.  But she d read a lot about him. Matthew Brandon. Writer. Millionaire. Blind man.
Prayers,The Prayers book is several things. It is a guide to salvation for those who have not been born again. It teaches relationship with the Lord  verses just being good or religious. It also teaches on what to expect as a Christian  how to pray  drawing near to God  and how you can and should grow as a Christian.This is followed by prayers on many various topics which are written from the perspective that God is all powerful  that the scriptures are inerrant  and that the Word of God is alive and powerful. We believe that those who have faith in God and have been saved by the blood of Jesus can pray these prayers and expect to have what they have prayed for  whether it be forgiveness of sin  healing  deliverance from bondage  or any prayer that is in line with the truth of God’s word.

Why Doesn t God Speak to Me?,Eager hearts cry out  hoping for a single word to confirm that He hears us. Yet  many times the only sound is silence. Over the years I have heard several reasons why God speaks to some and not to others. One night  as I tossed and turned  I brought each of these reasons before the Lord  stating why each of them did not line up with who I thought He was. Words rose from my soul  pleading for Him to reveal why He has remained silent when a single word from Him would mean so much to so many. For the next few hours  God used things I learned about years ago and things I had just discovered to show why He talks to some and why He doesn t  and in demonstrative ways. In His grace  He also showed me how people could hear more from Him. Thank you for taking time to consider the answers I received and share with you now.
