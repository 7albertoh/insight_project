# Publish or Perish: increasing visibility of self-published books


Self-published books do not get enough visibility. A reason is that authors do not have the resources that publishing houses do. Self-publishers need a data-driven way of selecting book tags to increase the number of reviews to increase visibility.

The solution is a web app for self-publishers to get keywords associated with more book reviews. The self-publisher inputs the book title and description of their book on the web app, and the app recommends book tags associated with 2 to 7 more reviews per month.
